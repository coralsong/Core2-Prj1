    "* Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door. *",

    "* Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. *",
    "* I invited him in, pointing to a chair. *",
    "* He paused awhile before speaking. *",
    "I sell Bibles.",
    "I don’t only sell Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you.",
    "* He opened the suitcase and lay the book on a table. *",
    "* Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words “Holy Writ” and, below them, “Bombay.” *",
    "I don’t know. I’ve never found out.",
    "* I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. *",
    "Look at the illustration closely. You’ll never see it again.",
    "No. I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner told me his book was called the Book of Sand, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.",
    "* The stranger asked me to find the first page. *",
    "* I opened the book. Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book. *",
    "Now find the last page.",
    "* Again I failed. *",
    "It can’t be, but it is. None is the first page, none the last.",
    "I don’t know why they’re numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any number.",
    "If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time.",
    "Yes, I’m a Presbyterian. I am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book.",
    "No. I’m offering it to you",
    "",
    "",
    "A black-letter Wiclif!",
    "It’s a deal.",
    "* I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on the shelf by the Wiclif, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of “The Thousand and One Nights.” *",
    "* I went to bed and did not sleep. *",
    "* At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the impossible book and leafed through its pages. *",
    "* I showed no one my treasure. *",
    "* To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. *",
    "* I had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. *",
    "* A prisoner of the book, I almost never went out anymore. *",
    "* At night, in the meagre intervals my insomnia granted, I dreamed of the book. *",
    "* Summer came and went, and I realized that the book was monstrous. *",
    "* What good did it do me to think that I, who looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my hands, was any less monstrous? *",
    "* Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest. *",
    "* One day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the door, *",
    "* I lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement’s musty shelves. *",
